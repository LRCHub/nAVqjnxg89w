Mic check, one-two, one-two
I don't write rhymes, nigga, I write checks

Now lemme turn this to the judge and throw the book out
Then skew it on the barbie like a motherfuckin' cookout
This-

Chef mad flavors
Bitches suck the energy, it's like a lifesaver
Shave it-

My third eye's open, I feel absolutely free
Violence in touch with my own inner energy
I'ma get loose like a barbed-wire fence
It's the significant, never frivolous, mister
It's the-

Don't compute then I gots to reroute ya

I feel unblocked, vulnerable but brave
My soul displaced from a desperate space
I brace my arms for the blow, I know
The truth comes next from broken faces
Potentials erased Lacerated, evaded
But now we've embraced it, we've finally made it

Swear to God
Naw, I'm like they ghetto
My dog, my dog talking 'bout, uh
You ain't get another nut
You talking all this mad shit, soon as you see, you freeze up
Like, shit
